config NVME_TARGET
	tristate "NVMe Target support"
	depends on BLOCK
	depends on CONFIGFS_FS
	help
	  This enabled target side support for the NVMe protocol, that is
	  it allows the Linux kernel to implement NVMe subsystems and
	  controllers and export Linux block devices as NVMe namespaces.
	  You need to select at least one of the transports below to make this
	  functionality useful.

	  To configure the NVMe target you probably want to use the nvmetcli
	  tool from http://git.infradead.org/users/hch/nvmetcli.git.

	  This enables the NVMe loopback device support, which can be useful
	  to test NVMe host and target side features.

	  If unsure, say N.
